# Project Title: UNIX Shell

## Project Overview
Shell in UNIX that behaves the same as Bash. The code is divided between three source files and uses Makefile to automate the building of the program. Thus we only recompile each source file when needed. When executed the code should:

* Print a prompt (# character)
* Read a line
* Execute the command with given arguments
* Wait until command completes
* Print prompt again and accept more commands
* Exit when EOF is received (Ctrl+D)

## Features included:
- [x] EXEC and FORK
- [x] Date in prompt
- [x] Catch SIGINT signal
- [x] Change directory builtin
- [x] Redirect builtin
